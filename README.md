# Rhield

A toy obfuscator built using [zasm](https://github.com/zyantific/zasm).\
Code was hacked together and is pretty messy. Project was mainly built to test ideas. I have since started work on a properly written obfuscator.\
There is a lot of bugs, unfinished todos and questionable code. don't judge :)
